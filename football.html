	Football/Soccer is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.</p>

	The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes "a party of boys ... playing at ball".[30] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[31] date from the 12th century.[32]

	The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "mob football", would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse,[33] struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder[34] to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.[35] The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,[34] and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).
